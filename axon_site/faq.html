    <div class="faq-list">
      <details>
        <summary>What is the difference between a fixed and variable interest rate?</summary>
        <p>With a fixed rate your repayments remain the same for a set period, giving you certainty. A variable rate can move up or down based on market factors. We can help you decide which option suits your needs.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do I need a 20&#x202f;% deposit to buy a home?</summary>
        <p>While a 20&#x202f;% deposit is ideal, there are options for lower deposits. Lenders mortgage insurance may apply on loans above 80&#x202f;% of the property value. We’ll explain deposit requirements and the pros and cons of different structures.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What documentation do I need for loan pre‑approval?</summary>
        <p>Generally you’ll need proof of income (payslips or tax returns), savings history, identification and details of your expenses and liabilities. We’ll guide you through the paperwork and make the process as simple as possible.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I get a home loan if I’m self‑employed?</summary>
        <p>Yes. There are specialised loans for self‑employed borrowers that use alternative forms of income verification such as business financials or accountant declarations. We’ll assess your situation and recommend suitable lenders.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How long does loan approval take?</summary>
        <p>Timeframes vary depending on the lender and complexity of your situation. Conditional pre‑approval can often be obtained within a few days. Full approval after your property is found may take a week or more. We manage the process and keep you informed.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do your services cost anything?</summary>
        <p>In most cases our service is at no cost to you — we receive a commission from the lender once your loan settles. If any fees do apply, we’ll disclose them upfront so there are no surprises.</p>
