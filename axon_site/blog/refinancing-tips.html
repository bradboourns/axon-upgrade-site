    <h1>5 Signs It’s Time to Refinance</h1>
    <p><em>Published: 9 August 2025</em></p>
    <p>Refinancing your mortgage can provide benefits beyond chasing lower rates. Here are five signs it may be worth a closer look:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Your circumstances have changed:</strong> A higher income, new job or growing family might mean your current loan no longer fits. Refinancing could give you more flexibility.</li>
      <li><strong>You’re coming off a fixed‑rate period:</strong> When your fixed term ends, your loan may revert to a higher variable rate. Refinancing lets you explore more suitable options.</li>
      <li><strong>You want to access equity:</strong> If your property has increased in value, you may be able to release equity for renovations, investments or debt consolidation.</li>
      <li><strong>Your goal is to pay off your loan sooner:</strong> Switching to a loan with features like offset accounts or the ability to make extra repayments could help you reduce costs and pay off your home faster.</li>
      <li><strong>You’re paying for features you don’t use:</strong> If you’re being charged for bells and whistles you never utilise, a simpler product might save you money and better match your needs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Every situation is unique. Talk to us to see if refinancing makes sense for you.</p>
